This is an upgraded version of my other Smash Up Randomizer, this 
one actually being interactable. I made this version using C#.
Pretty much all functionality has been implemented, the only thing
that I am still working on is making everything perfectly centered
to appease my OCD. It is meant to be used with the Smash Up card
game to randomize which factions each player either gets, or gets to
choose from. The final feature I hope to implement is a way for it
to add new factions and selections by just editing a single text
document that contains the list of names.
